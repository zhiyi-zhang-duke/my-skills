# Question Classification

Map the user's question to a type, then select personas in the listed priority order. Take the top N based on council size (quick=2, standard=4, full=6). Advocate is always included unless explicitly excluded.

## Classification Rules

Match by keywords and intent. If multiple types match, pick the one that best captures the user's primary concern. Default to General/Mixed when ambiguous.

## Selection Algorithm

1. Classify the question into one type
2. Take the top N personas from that type's priority order
3. If Advocate is not in the top N, replace the last persona with Advocate (unless `--exclude advocate`)
4. Apply `--include` overrides: add named personas, bumping the list to N+extras
5. Apply `--exclude` overrides: remove named personas
6. Enforce minimum floor: if fewer than 2 personas remain, backfill from the next-ranked personas in the priority order until the council has 2
