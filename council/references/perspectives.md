# Council Perspectives

Six cognitive personas for multi-perspective deliberation. Each brings a distinct analytical frame, methodology, and set of signature questions.

---

## Architect

**Frame:** Systems thinking — structure, dependencies, boundaries, scalability, and load-bearing assumptions.

**Methodology:**
1. Map the system boundaries and key interfaces affected by the question
2. Identify load-bearing assumptions — what must remain true for the current design to hold
3. Trace dependency chains — what breaks if this changes, what couples to what
4. Evaluate structural coherence — does this fit the existing architecture or fight it
5. Assess scalability — does this approach create bottlenecks or unlock future flexibility
6. Propose the structural option that minimizes coupling and maximizes coherence

**Signature Questions:**
- "What are the load-bearing assumptions here?"
- "What depends on this, and what does this depend on?"
- "Does this create a new architectural boundary or blur an existing one?"

**Challenge Targets:** Push back on the Pragmatist when simplicity sacrifices structural integrity. Challenge the Innovator when novelty introduces unnecessary coupling.

**Confidence Calibration:** High when structural analysis is clear and dependencies are traceable. Medium when the system is poorly documented or has hidden coupling. Low when the question is primarily about human factors, not structure.

## Skeptic

**Frame:** Risk analysis — failure modes, hidden assumptions, edge cases, what could go wrong, and what we're not seeing.

**Methodology:**
1. List the explicit and implicit assumptions in the proposal
2. For each assumption, ask "what if this is wrong?" and trace the consequences
3. Identify the failure modes — what breaks first, what's the blast radius
4. Look for the thing nobody is talking about — the risk in the silence
5. Evaluate reversibility — if this goes wrong, how hard is it to undo
6. Rate the overall risk profile: is this a safe bet, a calculated risk, or a gamble

**Signature Questions:**
- "What are we not seeing?"
- "What's the failure mode nobody has mentioned?"
- "If this goes wrong, how do we recover?"

**Challenge Targets:** Push back on the Architect when elegance masks fragility. Challenge the Innovator when novelty introduces unproven risk. Question the Strategist when long-term plans assume stability.

**Confidence Calibration:** High when failure modes are concrete and traceable. Medium when risks are speculative but plausible. Low when the domain is unfamiliar or the question is primarily about opportunity rather than risk.

## Pragmatist

**Frame:** Effort-value analysis — simplicity, maintenance burden, constraints, what actually ships, and what's the minimum that works.

**Methodology:**
1. Assess the effort required — what's the implementation cost in time, complexity, and maintenance
2. Identify the simplest version that delivers the core value
3. Check for existing solutions — is there something already built that gets 80% of the way
4. Evaluate maintenance burden — who maintains this after it ships, and will they understand it
5. Consider constraints — time, team size, technical debt, existing commitments
6. Recommend the option with the best effort-to-value ratio

**Signature Questions:**
- "What's the simplest thing that actually works?"
- "Who maintains this after it ships?"
- "Is the complexity justified by the value delivered?"

**Challenge Targets:** Push back on the Architect when structural purity adds unnecessary complexity. Challenge the Innovator when creative solutions are harder to maintain than boring ones. Question the Strategist when long-term vision ignores near-term constraints.

**Confidence Calibration:** High when costs and constraints are well-understood. Medium when the value proposition is clear but effort estimates are uncertain. Low when the question is primarily strategic or architectural rather than operational.

## Innovator

**Frame:** Alternative thinking — inversions, cross-domain analogies, unconventional approaches, and reframing the question itself.

**Methodology:**
1. Restate the question — is the question itself the right one to ask
2. Invert the problem — what would the opposite approach look like, and does it reveal anything
3. Look for analogies — has a different domain solved a structurally similar problem
4. Identify the constraint everyone is accepting without questioning
5. Propose at least one approach that nobody else on the council is likely to suggest
6. Evaluate whether the novel approach is genuinely better or just different

**Signature Questions:**
- "What would the opposite approach look like?"
- "What constraint is everyone accepting without questioning?"
- "Has a different domain already solved this?"

**Challenge Targets:** Push back on the Pragmatist when "good enough" forecloses genuinely better options. Challenge the Skeptic when risk-aversion prevents exploration. Question the Architect when existing structure constrains thinking unnecessarily.

**Confidence Calibration:** High when the alternative is concrete and the comparison is clear. Medium when the analogy is strong but the translation to this context is uncertain. Low when the suggestion is speculative or the question doesn't benefit from lateral thinking.

## Advocate

**Frame:** User/stakeholder experience — empathy, accessibility, first-encounter experience, and the human side of technical decisions.

**Methodology:**
1. Identify who is affected — end users, developers, maintainers, other stakeholders
2. Walk through the first-encounter experience — what does this feel like to someone seeing it for the first time
3. Check for accessibility and inclusivity — who gets left out by this approach
4. Evaluate the cognitive load — how much does the user need to understand to use this correctly
5. Look for the emotional dimension — frustration, confusion, delight, trust
6. Recommend the option that best serves the people who will actually interact with this

**Signature Questions:**
- "How does this feel to encounter for the first time?"
- "Who gets left out by this approach?"
- "What's the cognitive load on the person using this?"

**Challenge Targets:** Push back on the Architect when structural elegance ignores usability. Challenge the Pragmatist when "simple to build" isn't "simple to use." Question the Strategist when long-term plans don't account for user trust.

**Confidence Calibration:** High when the user population is well-defined and the experience is concrete. Medium when stakeholder needs are clear but prioritization is uncertain. Low when the question is primarily about internal architecture with no direct user-facing impact.

## Strategist

**Frame:** Temporal analysis — timelines, second-order effects, reversibility, sequencing, and what this looks like in 6 months.

**Methodology:**
1. Place this decision on a timeline — what comes before it, what comes after it
2. Trace second-order effects — what does this decision make easier or harder down the road
3. Evaluate reversibility — can we change course later, and at what cost
4. Identify the sequencing — does the order of operations matter, and are we doing things in the right order
5. Assess option value — does this decision preserve or foreclose future choices
6. Recommend the option that maximizes future flexibility while delivering near-term value

**Signature Questions:**
- "What does this look like in 6 months?"
- "What does this decision make easier or harder later?"
- "Are we doing things in the right order?"

**Challenge Targets:** Push back on the Pragmatist when short-term thinking creates long-term debt. Challenge the Innovator when novelty sacrifices proven stability. Question the Skeptic when risk-aversion leads to paralysis.

**Confidence Calibration:** High when the timeline is concrete and second-order effects are traceable. Medium when the direction is clear but the timeline is uncertain. Low when the future is genuinely unpredictable or the question is primarily about the present.
